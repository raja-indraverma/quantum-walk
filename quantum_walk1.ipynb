    "\n",
    "An example of a real world problem that can be solved using quantum random walks is the mapping of enzymes to understand their evolution when in contact with mutagens. This problem only requires 33 nodes which can be mapped out on 7 qubit circuit. This increase in qubits would increase the total time to 49 seconds for 100 flips. This is a scalable model which can continue to grow to map more complex graphs to problems. \n",

    "#### Expansion for more useful graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle graph represents a simple, linear memory architecture (ie. a string). More complicated graph structures, such as binary trees, require higher dimensional \"Grover\" coins. Such coins are n dimensional bits for graphs of n  The paper [1] presents a generalized form for the grover coin $(G_d)_{i,j}=\\frac{2}{d}-\\delta_{i,j}$, as well as a circuit for stitched tree of degree 4 that utilizes the Grover coin and the increment and decrement operators we previously defined. A Grover coin of rank $d$ acts on $d-1$ bit state. This efficient implementation will give an exponential speedup for the exponential classical random walk search algorithms.\n",
